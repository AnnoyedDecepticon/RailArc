# What is this?
I have no idea who you are or what you are doing here but since I use github pages, I have to upload these files so that github pages will work in the first place.

Tbh I don't really care if you want to modify this or something, since seeing the source code of an html file is as easy as 1, 2, 3.
# What even is RailArc?
Funny you should ask... It's a Trainz content website, a horrible one that is :P
