  <h1>About Us</h1>
</div>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Our goal from the very beginning is to create free and high quality assets.</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center;font-size:15px">Whether it's Trains, Coaches, or Sceneries.
We've always dreamed of having some certain train in Trainz, only to be disappointed that they don't exist.
RailArc consists of 2 users, Reverie (re57k on Auran Forums) and Nopeissnope2. IRL we're both great friends sharing
similar interests, especially with military and trains. Reverie (me) acts as the website maintainer, modeller,
texturer, and occassionally scripter. I do the European side of this site. Nopeissnope2 does the Japanese portion
of this site, he also acts as a modeller, texturer, and he specializes in scripting things. Some of his meshes ended
up on me because he's too busy with other things. </p>
